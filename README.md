_Testing Library for Microsoft Extension Logging._

[![Build Status](https://alefranz.visualstudio.com/MELT/_apis/build/status/alefranz.MELT?branchName=master)](https://alefranz.visualstudio.com/MELT/_build/latest?definitionId=1?branchName=master) [![](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/MELT.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MELT/)

## About MELT

MELT is a free, open source, testing library for the .NET Standard _Microsoft Extension Logging_ library.
It is a solution to easily test logs.

It is a repackaging with a sweetened API and some omissions of [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Testing](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/tree/master/src/Logging/Logging.Testing), a library used internally in [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) for testing the logging, given that [there is currently no plan to offer an official package for it](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/issues/672#issuecomment-532850535).

It is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/alefranz/MELT/blob/master/LICENSE).
Most of the code is copyrighted by the .NET Foundation as mentioned in the files headers.

## Quick start

* Install the NuGet package [MELT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MELT/)

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="MELT" Version="0.1.0" />
    ```

* Get a test logger factory

    ```csharp
    var loggerFactory = MELTBuilder.CreateLoggerFactory();
    ```

* Get a logger from the factory as usual, to pass ro your fixture.

    ```csharp
    var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<Sample>();
    ```

#### Assert log entries

The logger factory expose a property `LogEntries` that enumerates all the logs captured.
Each entry expose all the relevant property for a log.

For example, to test with xUnit that a single log has been emitted and it had a specific message:

```csharp
var log = Assert.Single(loggerFactory.LogEntries);
Assert.Equal("The answer is 42", log.Message);
```

#### Assert scopes

The logger factory expose a property `Scopes` that enumerates all the scopes captured.

For example, to test with xUnit that a single scope has been emitted and it had a specific message:

```csharp
var scope = Assert.Single(loggerFactory.Scopes);
Assert.Equal("I'm in the GET scope", scope.Message);
```

There is also a property `Scope` in each log entry to have the scope captured with that entry.

#### Easily test log or scope properties with xUnit

* Install the NuGet package [MELT.Xunit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MELT.Xunit/)

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="MELT.Xunit" Version="0.1.0" />
    ```

* Use the `LogValuesAssert.Contains(...)` helpers.
For example, to test that a single log has been emitted and it had a property `number` with value `42`:

    ```csharp
    var log = Assert.Single(loggerFactory.LogEntries);
    LogValuesAssert.Contains("number", 42, log.Properties);
    ```

## Quick start for ASP.NET Core integration tests

* Install the NuGet package [MELT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MELT/)

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="MELT" Version="0.1.0" />
    ```

* Create a test sink using `MELTBuilder.CreateTestSink(...)`, where you can also customize the bahaviour.

    For example to filter all log entries and scopes not generated by loggers consumed in the `SampleWebApplication.*` namespace (this filters the logger name so it assumes you are using `ILogger<T>` or following the default naming convention for your loggers.)

    ```csharp
    var sink = MELTBuilder.CreateTestSink(options => options.FilterByNamespace(nameof(SampleWebApplication)));
    ```

* Use the `AddTestLogger(...)` extension method to add the test logger provider to the logging builder. This can be done where you are already configuring the web host builder.

    Configure the logger using `WithWebHostBuilder` on the factory.

    ```csharp
    using using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
    // ...
    factory = factory.WithWebHostBuilder(builder => builder.ConfigureLogging(logging => logging.AddTestLogger(_sink)));
    ```

    Alternatively, you can configure the logger builder in the `ConfigureWebHost` implementation of your custom `WebApplicationFactory<T>`,

    The logger will be automatically injected with Dependency Injection.

#### Assert log entries

The `sink` expose a property `LogEntries` that enumerates all the logs captured.
Each entry expose all the relevant property for a log.

For example, to test with xUnit that a single log has been emitted and it had a specific message:

```csharp
var log = Assert.Single(sink.LogEntries);
Assert.Equal("The answer is 42", log.Message);
```

#### Assert scopes

The `sink` expose a property `Scopes` that enumerates all the scopes captured.

For example, to test with xUnit that a single scope has been emitted and it had a specific message:

```csharp
var scope = Assert.Single(sink.Scopes);
Assert.Equal("I'm in the GET scope", scope.Message);
```

There is also a property `Scope` in each log entry to have the scope captured with that entry.

#### Easily test log or scope properties with xUnit

* Install the NuGet package [MELT.Xunit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MELT.Xunit/)

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="MELT.Xunit" Version="0.1.0" />
    ```

* Use the `LogValuesAssert.Contains(...)` helpers.
For example, to test that a single log has been emitted and it had a property `number` with value `42`:

    ```csharp
    var log = Assert.Single(sink.LogEntries);
    LogValuesAssert.Contains("number", 42, log.Properties);
    ```
