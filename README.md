## About MELT

MELT is a free, open source, testing library for the .NET Standard _Microsoft Extensions Logging_ library.
It is a solution to easily test logs.

It is a repackaging with a sweetened API and some omissions of [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Testing](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/tree/master/src/Logging/Logging.Testing), a library used internally in [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) for testing the logging, given that [there is currently no plan to offer an official package for it](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions/issues/672#issuecomment-532850535).

It is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/alefranz/MELT/blob/master/LICENSE).
Most of the code is copyrighted by the .NET Foundation as mentioned in the files headers.

## Index

* [Quick start](README.md#quick-start)
* [Quick start for ASP.NET Core integration tests](README.md#quick-start-for-aspnet-core-integration-tests)

## Quick start

* Install the NuGet package [MELT](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MELT/)

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="MELT" Version="0.3.0" />
    ```

* Get a test logger factory

    ```csharp
    var loggerFactory = MELTBuilder.CreateLoggerFactory();
    ```

* Get a logger from the factory as usual, to pass ro your fixture.

    ```csharp
    var logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<Sample>();
    ```

### Assert log entries

The logger factory expose a property `LogEntries` that enumerates all the logs captured.
Each entry expose all the relevant property for a log.

For example, to test with xUnit that a single log has been emitted and it had a specific message:

```csharp
var log = Assert.Single(loggerFactory.LogEntries);
Assert.Equal("The answer is 42", log.Message);
```

### Assert scopes

The logger factory expose a property `Scopes` that enumerates all the scopes captured.

For example, to test with xUnit that a single scope has been emitted and it had a specific message:

```csharp
var scope = Assert.Single(loggerFactory.Scopes);
Assert.Equal("I'm in the GET scope", scope.Message);
```

There is also a property `Scope` in each log entry to have the scope captured with that entry.

### Easily test log or scope properties with xUnit

* Install the NuGet package [MELT.Xunit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MELT.Xunit/)

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="MELT.Xunit" Version="0.3.0" />
    ```

* Use the `LogValuesAssert.Contains(...)` helpers.
For example, to test that a single log has been emitted and it had a property `number` with value `42`:

    ```csharp
    var log = Assert.Single(loggerFactory.LogEntries);
    LogValuesAssert.Contains("number", 42, log.Properties);
    ```

### And much more

You can assert againt all the characteristic of a log entry: `EventId`, `Exception`, `LoggerName`, `LogLevel`, `Message`, `Properties` and `Scope`.

### Full example

See [SampleTest](samples/SampleLibraryTests/SampleTest.cs).

## Quick start for ASP.NET Core integration tests

* Install the NuGet package [MELT.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MELT.AspNetCore/)

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="MELT.AspNetCore" Version="0.3.0" />
    ```

* Create a test sink using `MELTBuilder.CreateTestSink(...)`, where you can also customize the bahaviour.

    For example to filter all log entries and scopes not generated by loggers consumed in the `SampleWebApplication.*` namespace (this filters the logger name so it assumes you are using `ILogger<T>` or following the default naming convention for your loggers.)

    ```csharp
    ITestSink _sink = MELTBuilder.CreateTestSink(options => options.FilterByNamespace(nameof(SampleWebApplication)));
    ```

    You can also filter by logger name using `FilterByTypeName<T>()` or `FilterByLoggerName(string name)`.

* Use the `AddTestLogger(...)` extension method to add the test logger provider to the logging builder. This can be done where you are already configuring the web host builder.

    Configure the logger using `WithWebHostBuilder` on the factory.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing;
    // ...
    var factory = factory.WithWebHostBuilder(builder => builder.UseTestLogging(_sink));
    ```

    Alternatively, you can configure the logger builder in the `ConfigureWebHost` implementation of your custom `WebApplicationFactory<T>`.
    If you chose so, the same sink will be used by all tests using the same factory.
    You can clear the sink in the test costrctuctor with `Clear()` if you like to have a clean state before each test, as xUnit will not run tests consuming the same fixture in parallel.

    The logger will be automatically injected with Dependency Injection.

* Alternatively, you can set it up in your custom `WebApplicationFactory<TStartup>`.

    ```csharp
        using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
        using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing;

        public class CustomWebApplicationFactory<TStartup> : WebApplicationFactory<TStartup>
            where TStartup : class
        {
            protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder)
            {
                builder.UseTestLogging(options => options.FilterByNamespace(nameof(SampleWebApplication)));
                // ...
            }
        }
    ```

    You can then retrieve the sink to assert against using the extension method `GetTestSink()` on the factory.

    Please note that in this case all tests sharing the same factory will get the same sink.
    You can reset it between tests with `Clear()` in the costructor of your `xUnit` tests. For example:

    ```csharp
        public class LoggingTestWithInjectedFactory : IClassFixture<CustomWebApplicationFactory<Startup>>
        {
            private readonly CustomWebApplicationFactory<Startup> _factory;

            public LoggingTestWithInjectedFactory(CustomWebApplicationFactory<Startup> factory)
            {
                _factory = factory;
                // In this case the factory will be resused for all tests, so the sink will be shared as well.
                // We can clear the sink before each test execution, as xUnit will not run this tests in parallel.
                _factory.GetTestSink().Clear();
                // When running on 2.x, the server is not initialized until it is explicitly started or the first client is created.
                // So we need to use:
                // if (_factory.TryGetTestSink(out var testSink)) testSink!.Clear();
                // The exclamation mark is needed only when using Nullable Reference Types!
            }
        }
    ```

### Assert log entries

The `sink` expose a property `LogEntries` that enumerates all the logs captured.
Each entry expose all the relevant property for a log.

For example, to test with xUnit that a single log has been emitted and it had a specific message:

```csharp
var log = Assert.Single(sink.LogEntries);
Assert.Equal("The answer is 42", log.Message);
```

### Assert scopes

The `sink` expose a property `Scopes` that enumerates all the scopes captured.

For example, to test with xUnit that a single scope has been emitted and it had a specific message:

```csharp
var scope = Assert.Single(sink.Scopes);
Assert.Equal("I'm in the GET scope", scope.Message);
```

There is also a property `Scope` in each log entry to have the scope captured with that entry.

### Easily test log or scope properties with xUnit

* Install the NuGet package [MELT.Xunit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MELT.Xunit/)

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="MELT.Xunit" Version="0.3.0" />
    ```

* Use the `LogValuesAssert.Contains(...)` helpers.
For example, to test that a single log has been emitted and it had a property `number` with value `42`:

    ```csharp
    var log = Assert.Single(sink.LogEntries);
    LogValuesAssert.Contains("number", 42, log.Properties);
    ```

### And much more

You can assert againt all the characteristic of a log entry: `EventId`, `Exception`, `LoggerName`, `LogLevel`, `Message`, `Properties` and `Scope`.
